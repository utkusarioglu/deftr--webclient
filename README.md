# Deftr Webclient

Webclient repo for the deftr project.

## Dependencies

Note that this project is designed to be a submodule for a deftr parent.
Depending on what your involvement with the project is, please first choose a
parent and then import Deft Webclient repo as a submodule. Regardless of which
parent you use, **you will have to also clone the `deftr--public-api`.**

Currently available choices for parent repo:

- Deftr Fullstack at deftr--fullstack
- Deftr Frontend at deftr--web (soon)
